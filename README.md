<h2>⚠️ 停服公告 ⚠️</h2>
<p><strong>Unibot</strong>已于2024年11月1日22点正式停止所有公开服务。Unibot所提供的全部服务及其分布式客户端已无法继续使用。</p>

<h3>特别提醒</h3>
<p>由于Unibot的背景素材与代码已开源，可能会有其他bot使用标注“<em>Generated by Unibot</em>”的背景图，或使用修改后的Unibot源代码创建类似的bot。若您发现此类bot，请注意它们均非由我运营。</p>

<p>任何此类bot造成的后果与我无关，关于之后出现的新bot的问题也请不要询问我。</p>

注意：该项目开源部分由于缺少重要api实现无法自行部署！
